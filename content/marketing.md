I will reach out to my customers through several ways. First of all, I will advertise my website with the help of social media as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp etc. because every person is using social media in this technological era. Moreover, I will reach to them through newspapers and magazines. This is for those people who do not use these applications. I have noticed that some people here do not use mobile phones. I will also distribute pamphlets in this city at the starting of my business and monthly with the additional dishes I will also conduct seminars in Sault College and Algoma University to promote my business and I can attract people by participating in any food events that are organized in this city.
