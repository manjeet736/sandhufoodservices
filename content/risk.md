**1. Food allergies and safety of food:** - If someone has food allergy and he/she do not tell Properly then there may be some chances of dead if they eat that food. It will be a big risk for my business. This can lost my overall business even it is not my mistake. Moreover, if food is not safe then it is also risky for us. For instance, hot food should go in the hot temperature. If it is in the cold temperature then that food is not safe for them. \
\
**2. Poor internet connection:** - My overall work for the homemade delivery depends on the internet connection. Although I will do my best to make a good internet connection but sometimes technical issues can create a big hurdle in my business. During the time of food ordering by customers, if I lost the connection of internet then customers cannot reach me and they will not believe properly for the next time. \
\
**3. Delivery driver issues:** - This issue may become a big risk for my business. To explain, if anyone got injury or any miss-happening occurs then it will become a big risk for me. We all know, many delivery drivers died in a year due to more traffic on roads in big cities. \
\
**4. Quality of food:** - Although I explained in my every assignment that only I am creating a website for Indian street food but it is a competitive era. Therefore, anybody else can also sell the same food. If they are using everything same as me then it can lose my business. \
\
**5. Financial risk:** - If I advertise my website through social media, newspapers etc. and I have not enough budget to create my website, then it is a big risk for me. Furthermore, people will start ordering because I will have created my website before preparing kitchen work. \
\
**6. Irresponsible employees:** - If my employees do not co-operate with each other and they do not do work in a team then I will not achieve my goal to success this business and people cannot get the food according their wish. In result, customer satisfaction will not be there.
