The vision statement is all about the success of my website. The main purpose of this new venture opportunity is to provide the homemade food to all the needy people because we know most of the old people are living in this city. Secondly, International students especially from India who are living in sault Ste. Marie, away from their homes. They love spicy food but do not get from these restaurants. There will be healthier ingredients in homemade food and it will avoid food allergies too. I will try to reach every person to get to know their choice of food and will provide every Indian food item. This business will make me feel proud to be an Indian and I will also feel get connected to my field of study as I told in my previous assignment. This business will create more opportunities for me to be more successful as there are more international students coming in this city in upcoming days. This will be win-win situation for both of us because they will get the food according their tastes and I will get the chance to create more websites to expand my business after this successful business. This may create employment opportunities for people in this city as I will need to hire excellent cook and delivery drivers in my business.
